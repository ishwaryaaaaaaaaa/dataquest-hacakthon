## Data Schema (Frozen)

The system uses simulated news data with the following fixed schema:

- id (integer): Unique identifier for each news item
- title (string): Headline of the news
- content (string): Full text used for embeddings and RAG
- timestamp (ISO datetime): Time when the news arrives

This schema will remain unchanged across all phases.
